# [ðŸ“¡ XRay-16 engine typescript definitions](https://github.com/stalker-xrts/xray-16-types)
[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/stalker-xrts/xray-16-types/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stalker-xrts/xray-16-types/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml)

For usage with [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/getting-started).

<p>
Module contains xray engine globals typedefs for typescript. <br/>
By default x-ray export many bindings that can be used from lua scripts.

To check more details / correct typing you always can reference X-Ray source code.
Here we only try to represent correct types.

## ðŸ—» Docs 

Types documentation can be checked [here](https://stalker-xrts.github.io/xray-16-types/modules.html).

## ðŸŽ® Rules

For easier navigation over codebase and typing following rules are applied:

- Runtime accessible values should be re-exported with index.d.ts file, all other things are considered ambient
- Type declaration should have \@source docblock with matching c++ counterpart signature
- Follow tsdoc guidelines
- Variable and class namings follow c++ conventions for easier binding
- XRay types should be prefixed with XR, IXR or TXR
- If method is not native to X-Ray engine and was added in one of updates, mark it with comment annotation if possible

! Do not use XR\_\* prefixed classes in runtime since it will cause error, consider it only for typing.

## ðŸ“¦Extending C++ classes and overriding virtual methods

### Lua

<p>
C++ classes can be extended in Lua code with 'class' keyword. 
Class declaration registers table as userdata and adds constructor/destructor metamethods. <br/>
</p>

### Typescript

<p>
In TS codebase '@LuabindClass' decorator can be used to modify transformation and enable virtual calls. <br/>
Separate transformer is needed to build luabind classes instead of table-based classes.
</p>

## ðŸ§± How to get up-to-date LUA bindings

- Run game engine with `-dump_bindings` flag
- Check userdata folder _(where game saves are stored)_ `scriptbindings_*.txt` files
